  You cannot sue someone for more than $10,000 in small claims court.
subquestion: |
  If you wanted to sue someone for more than $10,000, but will settle for $10,000, you can use small claims court to get the $10,000. Some people do this because small claims court is easier and cheaper than going to the Civil Division of Vermont Superior Court.
